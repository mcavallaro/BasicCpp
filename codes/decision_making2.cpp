/* 
This is decision_making2.cpp file.
It will teach you how to use if-structures.

This is an example to explain if-statements in C/C++:
- Single line if : if ( condition ) statement;
- Several line if's: if ( condition ) { statement 1; statement 2;}
- if-else: if ( condition ) statement 1; else statement 2;
- nested if-else.

    EXERCISE: 
    - Read carefully the statements of the programme.
    - Try to understand what is the possible output as a function of the possible input.
    - What should be the code in case you want to have a second opportunity to the programme user?
