/* 
This is decision_making4.cpp file.
It will teach you how to use if-structures.

This is an example to explain if-statements in C/C++:
- Single line if : if ( condition ) statement;
- Several line if's: if ( condition ) { statement 1; statement 2;}
- if-else: if ( condition ) statement 1; else statement 2;
- nested if-else.

    EXERCISE:
    - Read carefully the comments and the code above. 
    - Do you understand it?
    - Identify the different if statements;
    - Can you be even more specific, for example, in line 77 the answer can be not a number...
      How can you change the code in order to prevent this case?
    - Can you think in other cases when the programme might not work?
